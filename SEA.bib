	Abstract = {An irreversible cycle model of the Stirling refrigeration-cycle, using a ferroelectric material as the working substance, is established. Several irreversibilities due to thermal resistances between the working substance and the heat reservoirs, regenerative losses in two regenerative processes, and heat-leak loss between the heat reservoirs are taken into account. The influence of these irreversible losses on the performance of the ferroelectric Stirling refrigeration-cycle is analyzed, based on a general expression of the polarization of ferroelectric materials and a linear heat-transfer law. The cooling rate is optimized for a given power input. Some fundamental optimal relations and general performance characteristic curves of the cycle are obtained. The maximum cooling rate and other relevant performance parameters are determined. Some special cases are discussed in detail. When the regenerative losses are neglected, the results obtained may be directly used to describe the optimal performance of a ferroelectric Carnot refrigeration-cycle. Moreover, it is expounded that the calculated results are very general and also suitable for the ferroelectric Stirling and Carnot refrigeration cycles whose working substances obey the Curie--Weiss law and Curie law. },

	Abstract = {Stirling engines (SE) are a market-ready technology suitable for residential cogeneration of heat and electricity to alleviate the increasing demand on central power grids. Advantages of this external combustion engine include high cogeneration efficiency, fuel flexibility, low noise and vibration, and low emissions. To explore and assess the feasibility of using \{SE\} based cogeneration systems in the residential sector, there is a need for an accurate and practical simulation model that can be used to conduct sensitivity and what-if analyses. A simulation model for \{SE\} based residential scale micro-cogeneration systems was recently developed; however the model is impractical due to its functional form and data requirements. Furthermore, the available experimental data lack adequate diversity to assess the model's suitability. In this paper, first the existing model is briefly presented, followed by a review of the design and implementation of a series of experiments conducted to study the performance and behaviour of the \{SE\} system and to develop extensive, and hitherto unavailable, operational data. The empirical observations are contrasted with the functional form of the existing simulation model, and improvements to the structure of the model are proposed based upon these observations. },

	Abstract = {This study is aimed at theoretical analysis of the effects of the geometrical parameters on the shaft work of the Stirling engines. The optimal combination of the phase angle and the swept volume ratio, that leads to maximization of the shaft work of the engine, is obtained under different specified conditions. Effects of the effectiveness of mechanism, the dead volume ratio, and the temperature ratio on the maximum shaft work of the engine as well as the optimal combination of the phase angle and the swept volume ration are evaluated. Theoretical analysis of the performance of three types of Stirling engines, α-, β-, and γ-type, has also been carried out, and a comparison in relative performance among these three types of engines is attempted. Results show that for the particular cases considered in this study, the β-type Stirling engine produces highest shaft work and the γ-type engine the lowest. In general, the γ-type engine must be very mechanism effective so as to deliver sufficient shaft work. However, among the three types of engines, the γ-type engine is most capable of operating with low temperature difference. On the contrary, the α-type engine is particularly not suitable for the applications with low temperature difference since its dimensionless shaft work is found to gradually vanish as the temperature ratio is increased. },

	Abstract = {Abstract In this article, an experimental investigation is carried out to examine the heat transfer characteristics of a coil type solar dish receiver under actual concentrate solar radiation conditions. During the test, the concentrated solar flux is approximately 1000 kW/m2 at aperture. The solar irradiance is almost unchanged (650 W/m2) for continuous two hours in the afternoon, which is used to analyze the energy and exergy performance of the solar receiver. Experimental results show that, the efficiency of the solar receiver is normally above 70% with the highest efficiency of 82%, whereas at steady state, the efficiency is maintained at around 80%. A very low value of the heat loss factor (0.02 kW/K) could be achieved during the current steady state operating conditions. The highest value of the exergy rate is around 8.8 kW, whereas the maximum energy rate can reach 21.3 kW. In addition, the highest exergy efficiency is approximately 28%, and the highest energy efficiency is around 82%. },

	Abstract = {The main objective of the present work is to develop a general-purpose numerical method for improving design/simulation tools for the concentrating solar collectors (CSCs) of concentrated solar power (CSP) systems. A new modelling method and homemade unified code with the Monte Carlo Ray-Trace (MCRT) method for the \{CSCs\} are presented firstly. The details of the new designing method and homemade unified code with \{MCRT\} for numerical investigations on solar concentrating and collecting characteristics of the \{CSCs\} are introduced. Three coordinate systems are used in the \{MCRT\} program and can be totally independent from each other. Solar radiation in participating medium and/or non-participating medium can be taken into account simultaneously or dividedly in the simulation. The criteria of data processing and method/code checking are also proposed in detail. Finally the proposed method and code are applied to simulate and analyze the involuted photo-thermal conversion processes in three typical CSCs. The results show that the proposed method and model are reliable to simulate various types of CSCs. },

@article{Fenies2015,
	Abstract = {Abstract A three phase free piston type double acting Stirling engine model is proposed and validated using experimental results. The modeling strategy is based on a combination of two sub-models: a global thermal model of the engine to deal with heat sources coupling and a detailed equivalent electrical network model which accounts for the gas and mechanical dynamic physics of the engine. Derived features, such as the amplitude, the frequency, the compression and the expansion powers are then finally obtained. The model is experimentally validated with a prototype of a free piston Stirling engine. Mean error on the amplitude, the frequency, the internal temperatures and the compression and expansion powers is 9\%, so the model is considered accurate enough to predict performances. For optimization purpose, a numerical analysis is performed selecting the three following critical parameters: (i) dead volume of the chambers, (ii) natural frequency of the mechanical oscillators and (iii) thermal conduction between hot and cold sides. Smaller dead volume, large oscillating mass and high insulation are to be sought for maximizing the performances. With a pressurization of 3 bar, a theoretical useful power of 18 W can be reach with conservative modification of the existing prototype. Moreover, energy and exergy analyses highlight the main losses in the system: thermal leakage, gas spring hysteresis as well as heat transfer and viscous dissipation in the heat exchangers. },

@article{Jia2016,
	Abstract = {Abstract This paper presents a linearization of the dynamic equation for a free-piston engine generator (FPEG), and simplifies it to a one-degree forced vibration system with viscous damping. The analogy between a mass-spring damper and a \{FPEG\} system is expressed, and the solution to the vibration system is solved. The model was successfully validated with respect to experimental data obtained from a prototype. The simulated piston displacement during steady operation showed similar trends with the test results and the error of the displacement amplitude was controlled within 3%. The state-space equations and the transfer function of the system are obtain using the fast response numerical model. An example of model application in the real \{FEPG\} control system was provided. Compared to the previous numerical model with differential approaches, the solving time of the proposed fast response model can be significantly reduced. The simplicity and flexibility of the proposed model make it feasible to be implemented to several computing software, i . e . Matlab, AMESim, Labview, Dymola et al. It can be easily implemented to real-time Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulation model for the future piston dynamic control system development. In addition, since it reveals how an \{FPEG\} operates in a resonant principle, the model is useful for parameter selection in the \{FPEG\} design process. },

@article{Ni2016,
	Abstract = {Abstract A key issue in designing and optimizing Stirling engines is to build a precise thermodynamic model to predict the output power, thermal efficiency, and detailed performance properties and provide useful information for further improvement. In this study, a thermodynamic model called Improved Simple Analytical Model (ISAM) was proposed, carefully considering heat and power losses in Stirling engines. A 100 W β -type Stirling engine was built and tested with helium and nitrogen when pressure and rotary speed ranging from 1.6 \{MPa\} to 3 \{MPa\} and 260 r/min to 1380 r/min, respectively. Experimental information on performance, such as \{PV\} diagrams and temperatures of the heater and cooler, was much detailed. Increasing rotary speed brings a ``thin'' \{PV\} diagram because it made compression and expansion processes become more imperfect, indicating heat transfer enhancement was necessary for compression and expansion chamber in a high speed Stirling engine. Shaft power reached the maximum value of 30.1 W for helium and 21.0 W for nitrogen at rotary speeds of 1000 r/min and 650 r/min, respectively. Improving the mean pressure of gas increased the indicated power, cycle efficiency, shaft power, and electrical power. The maximum indicated power and cycle efficiency were 165 W and 16.5% for helium and 139 W and 12.2% for nitrogen in the same working conditions of 2.96 \{MPa\} and 1120 r/min. The \{ISAM\} agrees well with the experimental data with a deviation of 4.3--13.4% for helium and 1--7.1% for nitrogen. Analysis of energy losses with \{ISAM\} indicated that helium had larger shuttle and seal leakage losses and smaller flow resistance and regenerator heat transfer losses than nitrogen under the same working conditions. Flow resistance and regenerator heat transfer losses, which increased much more rapidly than seal leakage or shuttle heat losses with the increase in rotary speed and pressure, played an important role and resulted in different performances with the two working gases. This study provides comprehensive understanding of the influence mechanism of rotary speed, pressure and working gas in the view of heat/power losses for Stirling engine performance, and recommends that more work (e.g., mechanisms of heat and power losses and \{PV\} diagrams) should be performed to improve the precision of second-order models. },

Reliable operation over a range of conditions including cloud transients has been demonstrated. Parallel theoretical investigations have established that maximising the potential for electrical power production from ammonia synthesis reactors, can largely be achieved through appropriate choice of average operating temperature in standard reactors. The possibility of operating the ammonia based system using trough concentrators has also been investigated theoretically, and the preliminary results indicate encouraging energy storage efficiencies in the region of 53\%. },

In this study a solar receiver meeting the specific requirements for integration into a small-scale (10 kWel) dish-mounted hybrid solar micro gas-turbine system has been designed with a special focus on the trade-offs between efficiency, pressure drop, material utilization and economic design. A situation analysis, performed using a multi-objective optimizer, has shown that a pressurized configuration, where the solar receiver is placed before the turbine, is superior to an atmospheric configuration with the solar receiver placed after the turbine. Based on these initial design results, coupled CFD/FEM simulations have been performed, allowing detailed analysis of the designs under the expected operating conditions. The results show that the use of volumetric solar receivers to provide heat input to micro gas-turbine based solar dish systems appears to be a promising solution; with material temperatures and material stresses well below permissible limits. },

In this design method, a heat transfer model of the absorber wall is used for analyzing the main heat transfer process between the cavity wall outer surface, the inner surface and the working fluid. Furthermore, a ray-tracing model based on the parameters of a real dish is utilized for obtaining the solar radiative boundary conditions for the heat transfer model. Impinging jet cooling technology is introduced due to its high heat transfer coefficient in the stagnation area, which can be used for cooling the peak flux on the cavity wall. After applying a well-designed impinging system, the temperature peak on the peak flux region in traditional receiver designs can be mitigated without introducing any over pressure drop problem. },

	Abstract = {Abstract In this study, a solar dish collector is considered with a rectangular cavity receiver. The investigated parameters were included the receiver aperture area (a2), receiver tube diameter, cavity depth, inlet temperature and mass flow rate through the receiver. This cavity receiver is used as the heat source of the organic Rankine cycle (ORC). The \{ORC\} system is considered with \{R141b\} as the working fluid at the saturated condition. The main objective is the calculation of the optimum parameters for attaining the maximum overall thermal efficiency of the system. With the help of the receiver modeling techniques, the optimum aspect ratios of 54.25, 40.69, 32.56, 23.25 and 18.09 are identified for five cavity depths of 0.5a, 0.75a, 1a, 1.5a, and 2a where the accompanying optical efficiencies are 89\%, 92\%, 94\%, 96\% and 96\%, respectively. It is concluded that for increasing the collector efficiency and overall thermal efficiency, a higher mass flow rate, and a lower inlet thermal oil inlet temperature are required. Also the results show that the optimum characteristic of the cavity for achieving highest collector efficiency and the highest overall thermal efficiency includes smaller tube diameter, lower inlet temperature of the working fluid, and the cavity depth of 1a. },

	Abstract = {Abstract Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) can be used as an efficient low cost energy conversion system to produce different types of energy, such as electricity, through the use of concentrated parabolic dish systems. In the study of CSP, most of the researchers focus on the heat losses and their relationships to the receivers' geometries. The present study concentrates on the optical efficiency as well as the flux distribution of the three different geometries: cylindrical, conical and spherical, of a cavity receiver, with the objective of analysing their behaviour using an advanced ray tracing method. The results of this study have shown that there is a connection between the flux distribution on the internal surfaces of the cavities and their optical efficiency. Moreover, the conical shape receiver received, as well as absorbed, a higher amount of reflected flux energy than the other shapes. The optical efficiency reached 75.3\%, 70.1\% and 71.5\% for the conical, spherical and cylindrical shapes respectively at surface absorptivity of 85\%. Also, the focal point location depends on the shape of the cavity receiver and its absorptivity. Thereby, there is an optimum distance for each design depending on these two factors. The results of the simulated work are validated using the experimental work found in the literature. },

@article{Sha2016,
	Abstract = {Abstract The optical performance of a solar dish concentrator/cavity receiver system based on the Monte Carlo Ray Tracing Method (MCRTM) was carried out under ideal optics. The study was precipitated by a need to analyze the influence of geometrical parameters and surface properties of a cavity receiver systematically and to understand the mechanism of the optical performance under various parameters. These include diameter ratio (the ratio of aperture diameter to absorber outer diameter), height ratio (the ratio of absorber height to absorber outer diameter) and sidewall absorptivity of cavity receiver. In addition, an optical efficiency of the absorber is defined and presented for the first time. The analysis indicates that the optical efficiency increases and then decreases with higher height ratio, while optical efficiency curves are reduced monotonically with diameter ratio. Simultaneously, the effects of the height and diameter ratios on optical efficiency are both influenced by sidewall absorptivity. Based on the results, a correlation of optical efficiency was further developed to quantify the influences of these factors. The maximum optical efficiency and its corresponding optimal height ratio from both simulation and correlation are presented and obtain reasonable agreement. The optimized selection of height ratio along with diameter ratio are suggested using this result. The height ratio is found to be a pure controlling parameter of the radiation flux distribution. },

This paper addresses the modelling and simulation of a solar powered Stirling engine system with parabolic dish and electric generator aiming to determine its energy production and efficiency. The model includes the solar radiation concentration system, the heat transfer in the thermal receiver, the thermal cycle and the mechanical and electric energy conversion. The thermodynamic and energy transfer processes in the engine are modelled in detail, including all the main processes occurring in the compression, expansion and regenerator spaces. Starting from a particular configuration, an optimization of the concentration factor is also carried out and the results for both the transient and steady state regimes are presented. It was found that using a directly illuminated thermal receiver without cavity the engine efficiency is close to 23.8% corresponding to a global efficiency of 10.4%. The components to be optimized are identified in order to increase the global efficiency of the system and the trade-off between system complexity and efficiency is discussed. },

	Abstract = {Abstract Popular thermodynamic analyses including finite time thermodynamic analysis was lately developed based upon external irreversibilities while internal irreversibilities such as friction, pressure drop and entropy generation were not considered. The aforementioned disadvantage reduces the reliability of the finite time thermodynamic analysis in the design of an accurate Stirling engine model. Consequently, the finite time thermodynamic analysis could not sufficiently satisfy researchers for implementing in design and optimization issues. In this study, finite speed thermodynamic analysis was employed instead of finite time thermodynamic analysis for studying Stirling heat engine. The finite speed thermodynamic analysis approach is based on the first law of thermodynamics for a closed system with finite speed and the direct method. The effects of heat source temperature, regenerating effectiveness, volumetric ratio, piston stroke as well as rotational speed are included in the analysis. Moreover, maximum output power in optimal rotational speed was calculated while pressure losses in the Stirling engine were systematically considered. The result reveals the accuracy and the reliability of the finite speed thermodynamic method in thermodynamic analysis of Stirling heat engine. The outcomes can help researchers in the design of an appropriate and efficient Stirling engine. },

	Abstract = {A technique for calculating the efficiency and power of Stirling machines is presented. This technique is based on the First Law of Thermodynamics for processes with finite speed and the Direct Method for closed systems. In order to apply the Direct Method to Stirling Cycles, a new and novel PV/Px diagram is presented that shows the effects of pressure losses due to friction, finite speed and throttling processes in the regenerator of the Stirling engine. The method used for the analysis of this irreversible cycle with finite speed involves the direct integration of equations based on the first law for processes with finite speed to obtain the cycle efficiency and power directly. This technique is termed the Direct Method. The results predicted by this analysis are in good agreement with the actual engine performance data of 12 different Stirling engines, over a range of output from economy to maximum power. This provides a solid verification that this analysis, based on the Direct Method, can accurately predict actual Stirling engine performance, particularly with regard to efficiency and output power. In addition to the powerful predictive capabilities of the Direct Method, the new PV/Px diagram for the Stirling cycle is both an effective and an intuitive tool for explaining the operation and design of Stirling machines.

	Abstract = {Abstract In this paper, a solar energy powered gamma type \{SE\} has been optimized using Finite Physical Dimensions Thermodynamics (FPDT) method by multi-objective criteria. Genetic algorithm was used to get the Pareto frontier, and optimum points were obtained using the decision making methods of \{LINMAP\} and TOPSIS. The optimization results have been compared with those obtained using the ecological method. It was shown that the multi-objective optimization in this paper has a better balance among the optimizing criteria (maximum mechanical power, maximum thermal efficiency and minimum entropy generation flow). The effects of the hot source temperature and the total thermal conductance of the engine on the Pareto frontier have been also studied. This sensibility study shows that an increase in the hot reservoir temperature can increase the output mechanical power, the thermal efficiency of the engine, but also the entropy generation rate. In addition to this, an increase of the total thermal conductance of the engine can strongly increase the output mechanical power and only slightly increase the thermal efficiency. These results allow us to improve the engine performance after some modifications as geometrical dimensions (diameter, stroke, heat exchange surface, etc.) and physical parameters (temperature, thermal conductivity). },

	Abstract = {Abstract Stirling engine has become preferable for high attention towards the use of alternate renewable energy resources like biomass and solar energy. Stirling engine is the main component of dish Stirling system in thermal power generation sector. Stirling engine is an externally heating engine, which theoretical efficiency is as high as Carnot cycle's, but actual ones are always far below compared with the Carnot efficiency. A number of studies have been done on multi-objective optimization to improve the design of Stirling engine. In the current study, a multi-objective optimization method, which is a combination of multiple optimization algorithms including differential evolution, genetic algorithm and adaptive simulated annealing, was proposed. This method is an attempt to generalize and improve the robustness and diversity with above three kinds of population based meta-heuristic optimization techniques. The analogous interpreter was linked and interchanged to find the best global optimal solution for Stirling engine performance optimization. It decreases the chance of convergence at a local minimum by powering from the fact that these three algorithms run parallel and members from each population and technique are swapped. The optimization considers five decision variables, including engine frequency, mean effective pressure, temperature of heating source, number of wires in regenerator matrix, and the wire diameter of regenerator, as multiple objectives. The Pareto optimal frontier was obtained and a final optimal solution was also selected by using various multi-criteria decision making methods including techniques for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution and Simple Additive Weighting. The multi-objective optimization indicated a way for GPU-3 Stirling engine to obtain an output power of more than 3 kW and an increase by 5\% in thermal efficiency with significant decrease in power loss due to flow resistance. },

	Abstract = {Abstract A solar-powered high temperature differential Stirling engine was considered for optimization using multiple criteria. A thermal model was developed so that the output power and thermal efficiency of the solar Stirling system with finite rate of heat transfer, regenerative heat loss, conductive thermal bridging loss, finite regeneration process time and imperfect performance of the dish collector could be obtained. The output power and overall thermal efficiency were considered for simultaneous maximization. Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) based on the NSGA-II algorithm were employed while the solar absorber temperature and the highest and lowest temperatures of the working fluid were considered the decision variables. The Pareto optimal frontier was obtained and a final optimal solution was also selected using various decision-making methods including the fuzzy Bellman--Zadeh, \{LINMAP\} and TOPSIS. It was found that multi-objective optimization could yield results with a relatively low deviation from the ideal solution in comparison to the conventional single objective approach. Furthermore, it was shown that, if the weight of thermal efficiency as one of the objective functions is considered to be greater than weight of the power objective, lower absorber temperature and low temperature ratio should be considered in the design of the Stirling engine. },

	Abstract = {A mathematical model for the overall thermal efficiency of the solar-powered high temperature differential dish-Stirling engine with finite-rate heat transfer, regenerative heat losses, conductive thermal bridging losses and finite regeneration processes time is developed. The model takes into consideration the effect of the absorber temperature and the concentrating ratio on the thermal efficiency; radiation and convection heat transfer between the absorber and the working fluid as well as convection heat transfer between the heat sink and the working fluid. The results show that the optimized absorber temperature and concentrating ratio are at about 1100 K and 1300, respectively. The thermal efficiency at optimized condition is about 34\%, which is not far away from the corresponding Carnot efficiency at about 50\%. Hence, the present analysis provides a new theoretical guidance for designing dish collectors and operating the Stirling heat engine system. },

	Abstract = {Abstract Thermal models for the simulation of Stirling engines need to have greater accuracy along with simple and low-cost calculation. In this regard, a new closed-form thermal model was presented for the thermal simulation of Stirling engines. The new model called \{PFST\} (polytropic-finite speed thermodynamics) was developed based on the combination of polytropic analysis of expansion/compression processes and the concept of finite speed thermodynamics (FST). Therefore, compression/expansion works of compression/expansion processes and transferred heat into the heater of Stirling engines were determined based on polytropic analysis, instead of isothermal processes of the ideal Stirling cycle. The calculated work of polytropic processes was corrected to include the effects of internal irreversibilities including pressure throttling in heat exchangers, mechanical friction, and finite motion of the pistons. Output power and thermal efficiency of Stirling engines were calculated as functions of various engine parameters. The developed \{PFST\} model was implemented on a prototype Stirling engine, called GPU-3 engine, and the obtained results were compared with those of other closed-form and numerical models as well as experimental data. It was found that the new closed-form model, in addition to its simple and low-cost calculation, had the same order of accuracy as recently developed numerical models. },

The steady state behaviour of the engine partly relies on non linear dissipative phenomena such as pressure drop loss within heat exchangers which is dependant on the temperature within the associated components. An analytical thermodynamic model which encompasses the effectiveness and the flaws of the heat exchangers and the regenerator has been previously developed and validated. A semi-analytical dynamic model of \{FPSE\} is developed and presented in this paper. The thermodynamic model is used to define the thermal variables that are used in the dynamic model which evaluates the kinematic results. Thus, a coupled iterative strategy has been used to perform a global simulation. The global modelling approach has been validated using the experimental data available from the \{NASA\} RE-1000 Stirling engine prototype. The resulting coupled thermodynamic--dynamic model using a standardized description of the engine allows efficient and realistic preliminary design of FPSE. },

The theoretical configuration approximates the five-space configuration common in Stirling cycle analysis. It comprises two working spaces and three heat exchangers: hot side, cold side and the regenerator between. The kinematic crank mechanism is replaced by electronically controlled motor/generator units, with one motor/generator controlling each of the working pistons. The use of stop valves permits the flow and non-flow processes inherent in the ideal cycle to be realised.

@article{Araoz2015,
	Abstract = {Abstract The Stirling engine is a closed-cycle regenerative system that presents good theoretical properties. These include a high thermodynamic efficiency, low emissions levels thanks to a controlled external heat source, and multi-fuel capability among others. However, the performance of actual prototypes largely differs from the mentioned theoretical potential. Actual engine prototypes present low electrical power outputs and high energy losses. These are mainly attributed to the complex interaction between the different components of the engine, and the challenging heat transfer and fluid dynamics requirements. Furthermore, the integration of the engine into decentralized energy systems such as the Combined Heat and Power systems (CHP) entails additional complications. These has increased the need for engineering tools that could assess design improvements, considering a broader range of parameters that would influence the engine performance when integrated within overall systems. Following this trend, the current work aimed to implement an analysis that could integrate the thermodynamics, and the thermal and mechanical interactions that influence the performance of kinematic Stirling engines. In particular for their use in Combined Heat and Power systems. The mentioned analysis was applied for the study of an engine prototype that presented very low experimental performance. The numerical methodology was selected for the identification of possible causes that limited the performance. This analysis is based on a second order Stirling engine model that was previously developed and validated. The simulation allowed to evaluate the effect that different design and operational parameters have on the engine performance, and consequently different performance curves were obtained. These curves allowed to identify ranges for the charged pressure, temperature ratio, heat exchangers dimensions, crank phase angle and crank mechanical effectiveness, where the engine performance was improved. In addition, the curves also permitted to recognise ranges were the design parameters could drastically reduce the brake power and efficiency. The results also showed that the design of the engine is affected by the conditions imposed by the \{CHP\} interactions, and that the engine could reach a brake power closer to 832 W with a corresponding brake efficiency of 26% when the adequate design parameters were considered. On the other hand, the performance could also be very low; as the reported in experimental tests, with brake power measurements ranging 52--120 W. },

We show that the engine efficiency with perfect regeneration doesn't depend on the regenerator dead volume but this dead volume strongly amplifies the imperfect regeneration effect.

In free piston Stirling engines (FPSEs), there are no mechanical linkages coupling the pistons or displacers, the motions of the reciprocating components follow the working gas pressure variations. Fillipo de Monte and G. Benvenuto have recently proposed a linearization technique of the dynamic balance equations. The aim of this paper is to predict the thermodynamic conditions for stable operation of \{FPSEs\} and their modeling. The equations of the angular velocity are solved analytically in terms of the working gas mass and the displacer--piston phase angle of the machine. Using the criterion of stable engine cyclic steady operation, a mathematically rigorous form is obtained for the main parameters of the engine. Furthermore, for simplicity reasons, thermodynamic magnitudes are obtained using the Schmidt analysis (isothermal model). },

Hence, the development and investigation of Stirling engine have come to the attention of many scientific institutes and commercial companies. The Stirling engine is both practically and theoretically a significant device, its practical virtue is simple, reliable and safe which was recognized for a full century following its invention by Robert Stirling in 1816. The engine operates on a closed thermodynamic cycle, which is reversible. Today Stirling cycle-based systems are in commercial use as a heat pump, cryogenic refrigeration and air liquefaction. As a prime mover, Stirling cycles remain the subject of research and development efforts. The objective of this paper is to provide fundamental information and present a detailed review of the past efforts taken for the development of the Stirling cycle engine and techniques used for engine analysis. A number of attempts have been made by researches to build and improve the performance of Stirling engines. It is seen that for successful operation of engine system with good efficiency a careful design of heat exchangers, proper selection of drive mechanism and engine configuration is essential. The study indicates that a Stirling cycle engine working with relatively low temperature with air of helium as working fluid is potentially attractive engines of the future, especially solar-powered low-temperature differential Stirling engines with vertical, double acting, and gamma configuration. },

@article{Tlili2008,
	Abstract = {A model of an irreversible cycle of the Stirling heat engine, using air as the working substance, has been established. Several irreversibilities due to the non-adiabatic regenerator dead volumes of hot space, cold space, and regenerator that the regenerator effective temperature is an arithmetic mean of the heater and cooler temperature. In addition, the general irreversibilities of the non-quasistatic cycle are taken into account. Numerical simulation is performed and the effects of the regenerator effectiveness and dead volumes are studied. Some fundamental optimal relations and general performance characteristic curves of the cycle are obtained. The results from this study indicate that the engine net work is affected by the cycle irreversibilities, while the heat input and engine efficiency are affected by both the regenerator effectiveness and dead volumes. It is concluded that the system operating temperature and the overall system efficiency depend on the internal irreversibility of the heat engine. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	Abstract = {In order to study further the promising free piston Stirling engine architecture, there is a need of an analytical thermodynamic model which could be used in a dynamical analysis for preliminary design. To aim at more realistic values, the models have to take into account the heat losses and irreversibilities on the engine. An analytical model which encompasses the critical flaws of the regenerator and furthermore the heat exchangers effectivenesses has been developed. This model has been validated using the whole range of the experimental data available from the General Motor GPU-3 Stirling engine prototype. The effects of the technological and operating parameters on Stirling engine performance have been investigated. In addition to the regenerator influence, the effect of the cooler effectiveness is underlined. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Hooshang2016,
	Abstract = {Abstract This study presents a dynamic model of a gamma-type Stirling engine and examines variations of the crank rotational speed against time (Dynamic response). Kinematic relations of the engine linkages were determined and Lagrange formulations were formed for rigid body dynamics. Working gas pressures on each surface of the rigid bodies were calculated over time using a third order thermodynamic analysis code. A test setup was established for measuring dynamic and thermodynamic state variables of ST500engine. First, experiment data was used to validate the thermodynamic code results. Then the dynamic formulations combined with the thermodynamic code were simultaneously solved and the result is compared to \{ST500\} dynamic response. Finally, using the whole dynamic model, new aspects of Stirling engine behavior were investigated. The dynamic--thermodynamic combination of the model gives the opportunity to instantly calculate a precise open-loop response, which is the essential part of designing proper load controllers for inherently unstable Stirling engines. },
