\begin{enumerate}
\item A novel idea of using SEA (Stirling engine array) to overcome the limitation of small engine capacity in dish-Stirling system was proposed.

\item Five basic connection types of SEA were summarized.

\item A Stirling engine model considering various irreversible phenomena was developed and validated.

\item Influence of flow type and flow order on the performance of SEA was investigated.

\item It was found that the flow order has little influence on the SEA performance.
